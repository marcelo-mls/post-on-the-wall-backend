  ### Built With
  </summary>
  
  For the development of this API was chosen [`Node.js v16`](https://nodejs.org/en), [`Express`](https://expressjs.com/) and [`MongoDB v6`](https://www.mongodb.com/). Together, these technologies provide a powerful and flexible stack for building APIs in the backend of web applications. They allow you to write scalable, efficient, and easy-to-maintain code. Additionally, the fact that they are all written in JavaScript means that you can use the same language and tools for both the frontend and backend of your application, which can help streamline development and improve code consistency.

  <p align="rigth">Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript that allows you to write server-side code in the same language as the client-side code. It's fast, efficient, and event-driven</p>
